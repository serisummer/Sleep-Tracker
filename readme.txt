6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I designed my app for users who prefer simplicity in their apps.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Both.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
Users can click on the Log Overnight Sleep button on the home page, it will direct users to the logging page. Users can then
select a start date-time and an end date-time, and click log. I chose to support it this way because it's simple and 
straightforward.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Same as the overnight sleep logging page except thee options are displayed using radio buttons. I chose to list all of the
options out instead of hiding them so that users can see all the options at once and make a more accurate decision.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
Users can view their logs by clicking on the overnight sleep log or sleepiness log button on the home page. I chose to
support it this way because it is simple and straightforward.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?



12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?



13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?



14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
Buttons for logging are at the top of home page. After entering the logging page, user can use the back button that is located
at the top left of the page. The close proximity of navigation buttons allows users to navigate through different pages without
having to move their fingers a lot, which makes the user interaction more smooth.
Users are also given the chance to confirm or cancel a log or delete, preventing users from accidentally doing things they
don't intend to do.
